Kadie, a kidney dialysis nurse from Yorkshire, England, met partner Alejandro through an international dating site. Alejandro, a teacher, resides in Guadalajara, Mexico. Despite the odds — and distance — against them, the two were determined to make things work.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 data-injectable=false>Kadie and Alejandro’s story so far</h2><p data-characters=559 data-current-count=559 data-injectable=true>When Alejandro traveled to the U.K. to meet Kadie, he quickly won over Kadie’s grandmother, who had raised her since childhood. When Kadie met Alejandro’s parents in Guadalajara, they appeared to be pleased with how happy their son was with his new partner. However, homesickness and a dislike of the cold British weather put Alejandro off moving to Kadie’s home country. Similarly, Kadie couldn’t make a good living as a nurse in Mexico’s current economic condition and didn’t want to leave her grandmother and dog behind.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/kadie-and-alejandro.jpg><p data-characters=418 data-current-count=718 data-injectable=true>However, these hurdles were not insurmountable in the eyes of the young couple. Alejandro and Kadie each spent time in each other’s native countries before deciding to get engaged by the end of season 1, after Alejandro proposes during a hike in Mexico. Season 2 of the series continues their journey, showing their wedding in Alejandro’s home country, attended by Kadie’s closest friends and family.</p><h2 id=h-are-kadie-and-alejandro-still-together data-injectable=false>Are Kadie and Alejandro still together?</h2><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The most recent episodes of 90 Day Fiancé UK season 2 showcased Kadie and Alejandro’s rather disastrous wedding in stormy weather in Guadalajara, but the couple still managed to say, “I do.”</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>However, during the time between filming and the reunion episode at the end of season two, things took a turn for the worse for Kadie and Alejandro. The couple did not appear alongside the other couples for the reunion, but host Katherine Ryan confirmed in a pre-prepared statement that the two had decided to separate after filming had wrapped, with Kadie requesting privacy in this difficult time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@kadieslifeandjourney href=#>@kadieslifeandjourney</a><p>A very special video from me.. 😭🤍👶🏽 It’s finally time to share something VERY special with the world. This video will help you all understand the last few months of my life. I want to say how hard these months have been, but how lucky I am to have the most amazing family, friends and dialysis family that have literally got me through the past few months. I once said something on tv. “How can you love somebody that you’ve never met? But it feels so right!l”. Well, now I finally know the meaning of what that means 😭🤍 My ‘littlest beautiful’ wants to say hello to you all, and say hello to all the kind people who support their Mummy. They will be making their entrance earth side early 2023. I can’t believe I’ve managed to keep it a total secret for this long! 😯 Can you believe it?! I’M PREGNANT 🤰🏼 2023 might of been the year from hell, but 2024 is going to be sweet like cinnamon for all of us! 🤍 Please see my instagram for further details! 💜 Yours truly, us 🤗</p><a title="♬ original sound - Kadie’s life & journey. 🩷✨" href=#>♬ original sound – Kadie’s life & journey. 🩷✨</a></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>In a surprise turn of events, breaking up was not the end of the road for Kadie and Alejandro. In a September Instagram post archived by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Touch Weekly</a> before Kadie set her account to private, the native Brit revealed that she was pregnant with Alejandro’s child, despite their separation:</p><p>“As a married couple, this is something we dreamed of in our future and spoke about almost every day. My heart got broken into a thousand pieces by someone who I thought would be by my side forever. Although my baby wasn’t planned right now, they’ve come at the right time and I already love them so much. I can’t promise to be perfect, but what I can promise is to love you with my full heart and more.”</p><p data-characters=357 data-current-count=357 data-injectable=false>In a follow-up Instagram post, Kadie responded to speculation on social media, and confirmed that Alejandro would not be a part of their future child’s life. “I can’t speak on behalf of Alejandro, but I will say he decided a long time ago that he did not want to be part of the baby’s life and has not changed his mind on it,” Kadie wrote.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>In the same post, the reality star also offered some more insight into the end of her marriage to the Mexican national. “I can confirm he has not spoke[n] to me since I left his house in Mexico. I refuse to give my opinions or say nasty things on social media about him because one day our child could read it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kadie 🌻 (@kadieslifeandjourney)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>On February 18th, Kadie shared an ecstatic update with her followers. “Hello my beautifuls 🤍<br>It’s finally time for me to share some very special news with you all. Last week I became a Mummy,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote on Instagram</a>.</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>“I am totally and utterly in love with my little one, and I know how many of you are so excited for the news!

While Alejandro was not directly mentioned in the post, Kadie did seemingly double down on her previous post about her ex-husband not being a part of her life.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>“Ozzie is the only boy I’ll ever need now,” Kadie wrote, likely referencing Alejandro. “I’m so thankful for him already. He is so loved and adored by all his family/friends, we’re all SO IN LOVE.”</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=492 data-injectable=false>Since Kadie announced her split from Alejandro, the reality star has been off of social media, eventually deleting his Instagram account.
