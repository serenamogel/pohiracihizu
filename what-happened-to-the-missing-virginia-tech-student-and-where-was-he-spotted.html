According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ABC News</a>, on Feb 16, 2024, Roop told his friends he would drive home to Abingdon, Virginia, about 100 miles from Blacksburg, where VA Tech is located. While there, he said he would finish a test online at 5 p.m. that day. He left at 10 a.m., but at around 4:30 p.m., Roop’s phone pinged at a mall just a few miles away from his apartment complex. Roop never arrived at his parents’ home, and his friends said his behavior was out of character before he left.</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>According to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Post</a>, Roop’s mom, Veronica Widener, said her son’s phone died shortly after he vanished, and unconfirmed reports say Roop was seen in surveillance footage <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">withdrawing cash at the mall</a>.
