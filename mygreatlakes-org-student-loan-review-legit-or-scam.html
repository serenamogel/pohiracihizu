This means you can get some help from people who actually understand what you’re going through, instead of just taking your money without getting results.</li><li>Is Mygreatlakes org safe? Yes! It’s completely legitimate — they have many satisfied customers who vouch for them every day on their website or social media pages (Facebook).</li><li>GreatLakes puts customer support at the forefront of its business tasks; this means that if you ever have any questions about anything regarding your account or payment history, someone will be there to answer them right away using live chat or email exchanges (instead of having to wait on hold forever like other companies).</li></ul><h3><span id=GreatLakes_is_a_not-for-profit_company_with_a_community_focus>GreatLakes is a not-for-profit company with a community focus.</span></h3><p>GreatLakes is a not-for-profit company with a community focus.

You can choose from five fixed, variable or blended interest rates depending on your credit score. If you have good credit (a FICO score of 700 or higher), GreatLakes will give you the lowest possible rate on their student loan refinancing program. In some cases, this can save borrowers hundreds of dollars per month in payments plus thousands more over the life of their loan!</p><p>If you refinance with GreatLakes after graduation instead of consolidating, there’s also no prepayment penalty either! So if something happens unexpectedly—like losing a job—you won’t have to worry about owing money on top of that situation just because it’s already paid off already through regular monthly payments like most other companies do when they offer such services here at MyGreatLakes.”</p><h3><span id=Is_Mygreatlakes_org_safe>Is Mygreatlakes org safe?</span></h3><p>MyGreatLakes.org is a legitimate site.
