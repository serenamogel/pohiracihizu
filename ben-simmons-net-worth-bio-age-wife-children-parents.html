Simmons returned to Melbourne at the age of 10 and began playing junior basketball for the Knox Raiders. He played Australian rules football at a lower level in addition to basketball.</p><p>While attending Whitefriars College, Simmons was selected MVP in his seventh year after helping Whitefriars win the Division 1A Basketball Championship.</p><p>When he was younger, Simmons struggled to decide between his two passions for basketball and Australian rules football, but in the end he decided to focus just on basketball. Prior to accepting a grant at the Australian Institute of Sport in 2012, Simmons, then in his ninth year and 15 years old, competed for Box Hill Senior Secondary College in basketball at the 2011 Australian Schools Championships.</p><p>He was chosen to address Australia in the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship despite being only 15 years old.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Simmons Age</h2><p>He is 25 years old</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Simmons Wife</h2><p>From 2018 to 2019, Ben Simmons dated numerous women, including his girlfriend Kendall Jenner.

No need to worry, I’ll provide you all the details on his salary and net worth as of 2022 below.</p><p>His annual compensation is roughly 2.9 crores USD, or $33 million, and as of 2022, his net worth was about $6 million. In addition, he owns the $17.5 million LA house.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Simmons parents</h2><p>Fitzroy, a suburb of Melbourne, is where Simmons was born. Julie is his mother’s name, while Dave is his father.</p><p>Dave, Simmons’ father, was born in America but excelled at basketball in Australia. Simmons, a dual citizen of Australia and the United States, has performed for an Australian public organization.</p><p>His mother is an Australian white woman, and his father, Dave, is an American-African expat who became a naturalized citizen of that country. He was raised with five brothers and sisters: Melissa, Emily, Liam, Sean, and Olivia, the first four of whom are from his mother’s previous marriage.</p><p>Prior to becoming an expert with the Melbourne Tigers in Australia’s National Basketball League in 1989, his father competed in college basketball for Oklahoma City University in the United States.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ben Simmons career</h2><p>In a defeat to the Washington Wizards on October 18, 2017, Simmons made his NBA debut in his rookie campaign.

He has earned three NBA All-Star appearances since joining the Philadelphia 76ers in 2016.</p><p>It’s unclear at this time whether the 76ers will proceed with the deals involving Ben Simmons. The 76ers might not be interested in trading for him because he is among the finest defensive players in the NBA.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jpucp2Wjnrquu82sZKedpGLEsL7ToWSboZ9irqixjLCgn51dmLWquMOrnKdloJa%2FprrTrGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fben-simmons-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-parents.html&text=Ben%20Simmons%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fben-simmons-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-parents.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fben-simmons-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-parents.html&title=Ben%20Simmons%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fben-simmons-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-parents.html&title=Ben%20Simmons%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fben-simmons-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-parents.html&title=Ben%20Simmons%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fben-simmons-net-worth-bio-age-wife-children-parents.html&description=Ben%20Simmons%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Bio%2c%20Age%2c%20Wife%2c%20Children%2c%20Parents" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./movies.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nobody Cast, Actors, Producer, Director, Roles, Salary">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./joan-didion-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Age, height, husband, children, books">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
