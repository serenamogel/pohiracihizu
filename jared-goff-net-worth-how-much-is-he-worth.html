On October 14, 1994, he was born in San Rafael, California. Jerry Goff, his father, was a former Major League Baseball player. In 2013, Goff graduated from Marin Catholic High School in Kentfield, California.</p><p>He was offered multiple college scholarships but chose to attend the University of California, Berkeley. In the 2013 season, he was named the team’s starting quarterback. He set 26 university records and decided to forego his senior season in order to enter the 2016 NFL draught.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Los Angeles Rams selected Goff as the first overall pick in the 2016 NFL Draught.</p><p>He appeared in his first postseason game in January 2018. Goff completed 24-of-45 passes in the Rams’ loss against the Atlanta Falcons. He was named to his first Pro Bowl as a replacement for Carson Wentz a few weeks later. Goff set a career-high with 465 yards passing against the Minnesota Vikings in 2018. For his efforts, he was named to his second Pro Bowl.</p><p>Goff guided the Rams to an NFC Championship win over the New Orleans Saints. Goff’s contract was extended by the Rams for four years and $134 million in April 2019. Goff was transferred to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Matthew Stafford after a great 2020 season. In the opening week of the 2021 season, he made his Lions debut.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jared-goff-career><strong>Jared Goff career</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/usatsi_19788244-1-696x392.jpg><p>Goff was recruited by a number of college programs and received scholarship offers from Boise State, Fresno State, and Washington State before choosing to attend the University of California, Berkeley. Goff was a mid-year enrollee at Cal in January 2013 and joined the Golden Bears for 2013 spring practices.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>In August, he was named the starting quarterback for the 2013 season over redshirt freshman quarterback Zach Kline, becoming the first true freshman quarterback in Cal history to start a season opener.</p><p>Goff set 26 Cal records. This included passing yards (12,220), passing yards per game (329.7 ypg), touchdown passes (96), completions (977), passing attempts (1,569), total offense (12,086), and total plays (1,739). He is second only to Aaron Rodgers on Cal’s all-time list for passing efficiency (143.95).</p><p>Under new head coach Sonny Dykes, Goff started all twelve games in the 2013 season, and although the team finished 1–11, he set Cal single-season records for passing yards (3,508), yardage gained (3,508), total offense (3,446), passes completed (320), and passes attempted (530). Goff finished his true freshman season with a 60.3 completion percentage with 18 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.</p><p>In 2014, Goff was again the starting quarterback for the Golden Bears. In a September 27 matchup against the Colorado Buffaloes, Goff threw a career-high seven touchdown passes, completing 24-of-42 passes for 458 yards. On October 4, Goff threw for a new career-high and school-record 527 yards and five touchdowns in a 60-59 victory over Washington State.</p><p>Goff helped lead the Golden Bears to a 5–7 season, a four-win improvement over the 2013 season. He finished the 2014 season with 3,973 yards, 35 touchdowns, and a 62% completion rate, once again setting new school records.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-is-jared-goff-in-the-news><strong>Why is Jared Goff in the news?</strong></h2><p>Jared Goff is trending after he made a strong case to be league MVP. Goff&nbsp;is the straw that stirs the drink for a&nbsp;Detroit&nbsp;offense that is averaging the fourth-most points per game through six weeks (28.0 points/game).</p><p>On Sunday, the veteran quarterback completed 68.2% of his passes for 353 yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions. It resulted in a passer rating of 107.5 and a QBR of 78.6.</p><p>With the stellar performance, the former No. 1 overall choice now has 17 career games with at least 350 passing yards, which ties him for fourth most in a player’s first eight NFL seasons with former Pro Bowl passer Andrew Luck. Only Pro Football Hall of Famer Dan Marino and former Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford are ahead of him, as is two-time MVP and Super Bowl champion Patrick Mahomes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-net-worth-of-jared-goff><strong>Net worth of Jared Goff</strong></h2><p>Jared Goff is an American professional football player who has a net worth of $70 million.</p><p>source: <a href=#>www.ghbase.com</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC2wKucnWWXpLOnec2eq2avn6fBqXnHqK5mpaWYtW610mafnmWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjared-goff-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html&text=Jared%20Goff%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20He%20Worth%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjared-goff-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjared-goff-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html&title=Jared%20Goff%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20He%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjared-goff-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html&title=Jared%20Goff%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20He%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjared-goff-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html&title=Jared%20Goff%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20He%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjared-goff-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html&description=Jared%20Goff%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20Much%20Is%20He%20Worth%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./laura-rutledge-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laura Rutledge Net Worth 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-is-megan-thee-stallions-shoe-size.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Megan Thee Stallions shoe size?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
