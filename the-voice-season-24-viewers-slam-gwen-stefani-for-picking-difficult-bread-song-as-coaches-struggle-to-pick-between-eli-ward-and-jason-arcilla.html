Later, he trained himself to play the drums and guitar, and he began creating songs.</p><p>Eli had to learn to balance his multiple abilities in high school. He'd play jazz band before school, track after school, and then drumline after that, all while keeping excellent enough marks to be in the National Honor Society.</p><p>Eli is a cross-country track and field athlete representing the University of Iowa. When Eli runs, he breathes to the beat of the music he's listening to, and his runs may last up to 16 kilometers.</p><p>Eli, now a senior in college, has made the difficult choice to leave the squad in order to focus on music. He's in a band, and they occasionally play country covers.</p><p>Eli, on the other hand, wishes to concentrate on performing his own work, which is more singer-songwriter/pop.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/75b10a3a-16d4-4252-821b-b9551016d565.png><p>'The Voice' Season 24 airs on Mondays at 8 pm and Tuesdays at 9 pm ET on <a href=# rel>NBC.</a></p><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
