RZA united the <a href=#>legendary swarm of emcees</a> who all brought—and still bring—something unique to the table. It’s one of the reasons so many people love them and regard them as one of the most respected groups in hip-hop.</p><p id=par-2_62>With 25+ years in the game, the iconic crew has worked hard to build a legacy together and separately with multiple music projects and other endeavors. Here’s a glimpse at the net worths of the members of Wu, which <a href=#>consists of RZA</a>, GZA (Genius), Ghostface Killah, Raekwon, U-God, Masta Killa, Inspectah Deck, Method Man, Cappadonna, and the late O’l Dirty Bastard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/wu-tang-clan.png><h2>U-God</h2><p id=par-3_56>U-God—a.k.a. Lamont Hawkins—famously filed a lawsuit against Wu-Tang (the business, not his friends) for unpaid royalties back in 2016. Although he’s considered one of the original members of the group, in the early days, U-God’s musical contributions were hampered by his stints in jail and other issues, as <a href=#>The New Yorker</a> points out. For 1997’s Wu-Tang Forever, he was fully committed.</p><p id=par-4_22>Between music projects, his memoir, Raw: My Journey into the Wu-Tang, royalties, and investments, U-God has an estimated net worth of $5 million.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Inspectah Deck</h2><p id=par-5_48>As another one of the Wu’s founding members, Inspectah Deck (Jason Hunter) has an extensive track record in music that includes his work with Wu-Tang as a unit and as a solo artist. But did you know he’s also a producer who’s teamed up with some of hip-hop’s favorite artists?</p><p id=par-6_44>In addition to earning funds through music publishing, production in TV and music, and Wu-affiliated touring and ventures, the multidimensional Inspectah Deck told <a href=#>CityPages</a> he invests his money in the stock market and mutual funds. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the rapper’s estimated wealth is $14 million.</p><h2>Cappadonna</h2><p id=par-7_36>After contributing verses to various albums, Cappadonna is considered a member of Wu-Tang. He performs with the group and has released a bevy of solo projects. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, his fortune is estimated to be $4 million.</p><h2>Ol’ Dirty Bastard</h2><p id=par-8_57>We all miss Ol’ Dirty Bastard, who was one of Wu-Tang’s most creative lyricists and animated personalities. Not long before his death, he parted ways with the Wu-Tang’s label and signed with Roc-A-Fella. His widow runs his estate with some of his children, and in addition to handling his music royalties, they helped launched a cryptocurrency in his name called “Dirty Coin.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_33>According to <a href=#>Complex</a>, a biopic is also in the works. No concrete numbers for ODB’s estate could be nailed down, with The Richest placing the estate’s worth at $6 million and <a href=#>Celebrity Net worth</a> at $500,000.</p><h2>Method Man</h2><p id=par-10_49>Method Man has enjoyed a successful rap career with the group and on his own while branching into acting. Over the years, he’s done projects in film, TV, and music with Redman (and solo), and it’s recently been announced he’s in the cast of Power Book II: Ghost.</p><p id=par-11_19>Method Man continues to grow his reach and his wealth, which is estimated to be $20 million per <a href=#>The Cinemaholic</a>.</p><h2>GZA</h2><p id=par-12_56>Known for having cerebral lyrics, GZA’s body of work with Wu-Tang and on his own has achieved platinum status. He’s jumped into voice acting with 2020’s Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts and at one time, linked up with a Columbia professor to create a science curriculum using hip-hop (according to <a href=#>The New York Times</a>).</p><p id=par-13_10>GZA’s estimated net worth is $18 million, according to <a href=#>The Richest</a>.</p><h2>Masta Killa</h2><p id=par-14_49>In 2017, Masta Killa dropped his fourth studio album, and shared with <a href=#>Forbes</a> that he only had one rhyme on Wu-Tang’s Enter the Wu-Tang, and was a quick study of music and the business after that. Celebrity Net Worth estimates Masta Killa’s wealth to be roughly $1 million.</p><h2>Ghostface Killah</h2><p id=par-15_74>Ghostface Killah is one of the most popular members of the crew and he’s released more than one dozen solo albums. He’s always making music, and has had appearances in Netflix’s Luke Cage, has his own merchandise store where you can buy music, figurines, and apparel, and also had a line of vaping goods. According to various sources (including <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>), his wealth is estimated to be between $17 and $20 million.</p><h2>Raekwon</h2><p id=par-16_48>Raekwon Da Chef is not only a gifted rapper, but he’s also a savvy businessman. He continues to put out solo albums, do collaborations, and contribute to group Wu projects. In 2018, he launched his own sparkling wine brand, Licataa Lambrusco. Raekown’s <a href=#>estimated net worth</a> is $13 million.</p><p id=par-17_1><strong>RZA</strong></p><p id=par-18_36>Considered the de facto leader of Wu-Tang Clan, RZA not only produces music for the group, but he’s also acts, writes, and directs films. He’s retained licensing rights to Wu-Tang’s logo and other intellectual property.</p><p id=par-19_36>Like many other Wu members, he works on soundtracks and collaborates with other artists, and serves as a driving force behind Hulu’s Wu-Tang: An American Saga. According <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, RZA’s wealth is around $18 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEtnnTmqWgZZOhrq951qGgnKBdorKursSrZKieXam1pnnInKanoZNitLO71KlkoqtdqbWmedaemKWsmJ6ytMCNoaumpF8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwu-tang-clan-which-member-of-the-iconic-group-is-the-wealthiest-html.html&text=Which%20Member%20of%20the%20Iconic%20Group%20is%20the%20Wealthiest%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwu-tang-clan-which-member-of-the-iconic-group-is-the-wealthiest-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwu-tang-clan-which-member-of-the-iconic-group-is-the-wealthiest-html.html&title=Which%20Member%20of%20the%20Iconic%20Group%20is%20the%20Wealthiest%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwu-tang-clan-which-member-of-the-iconic-group-is-the-wealthiest-html.html&title=Which%20Member%20of%20the%20Iconic%20Group%20is%20the%20Wealthiest%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwu-tang-clan-which-member-of-the-iconic-group-is-the-wealthiest-html.html&title=Which%20Member%20of%20the%20Iconic%20Group%20is%20the%20Wealthiest%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwu-tang-clan-which-member-of-the-iconic-group-is-the-wealthiest-html.html&description=Which%20Member%20of%20the%20Iconic%20Group%20is%20the%20Wealthiest%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./namik-paul-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-528519-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Namik Paul Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ralph-ineson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ralph Ineson  Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
