He is 27 years old internationally, while his Korean age is 28.</p><p>Not to mention, V is the same age as his other member from BTS, <strong>Jimin,</strong> who also happens to be his best friend. Oh, little<strong> Chimmy</strong> and<strong> Tata.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Moreover, aside from being a best friend to his buddy, V also serves excellent looks. V stands at the height of 5 feet 10 inches(178 cm) and weighs around 66 kg(145 lbs).</p><p>V has an attractive pair of dark brown eyes.

Throughout his career, V had colored his hair in different shades.</p><p>In the N.O. era, he had dirty blonde, red-orange in ‘Boy in Luv,’ bright red in ‘Fire,’ crimson red in ‘Save Me,’ platinum blonde in ‘Blood, Sweat & Tears,’ half blonde and half pink in ‘Idol‘ era and so many more.</p><p>However, many fans think that the navy blue hair in their latest comeback, ‘Boy With Luv’ is their absolute favorite.</p><p>Well, everyone has their preferences. It is V’s fault for looking so good in each one of them. What do you guys think?</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jack Lowden Age, Height, Movies, Awards, Girlfriend, Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>Birthday Project</h2><p>Did not we all wonder how amazing it would be to have a birthday party like ‘My Sweet 16’ or another celebrity? Well, what we are about to tell you is going to put all that into shame.</p><p>As mentioned above, V and BTS as a whole love their fans. And the fans also never shy out from confessing their love towards them.</p><p>Similarly, with V’s birthday right around the corner, ARMY’s have found a unique way to celebrate his special day. Chinese ARMY lit up Gubei Water Town’s skies&nbsp;in an incredible drone display as part of V’s early birthday celebration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/v-0007.png><p>Furthermore, this special was not limited to China only. No way! That was going to happen. The Chinese fan sponsored the 2019 Seoul Christmas Festival, the largest festival in South Korea, and created an exclusive ‘purple zone’ at an event for his birthday.</p><p>This special event has left many speechless, including us. Imagine the power of the ARMY.</p><p>Wow! Fans and other people shared this fantastic event on Twitter, wishing him the best for his special day. And what’s impressive is that V is the first Korean Celebrity to have such grand dedication to him.</p><h2>Net Worth and Income: How Much Is V from BTS Worth?</h2><p>There’s no denying that BTS is one of the biggest boy groups in the world. With numerous hits around the globe, countless concerts, and let’s not even talk about their album sales. Yes, it is that much.</p><p>Moreover, it was mentioned that BTS brought about <strong>$3.6 billion</strong> to the South Korean economy alone.</p><p>As of 2021, BTS V has an estimated net worth of <strong>$20 million</strong>. That is the same as his other members,<strong> Jin, Jimin, </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jungkook</a><strong>, RM,</strong> and <strong>Suga</strong>. However, this number is sure to increase in the coming years.</p><p>Similarly, V is earning from his ability as a producer and writer of BTS’s songs.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cailin Russo Age, Height, Model, Music, Dating, Net Worth >></a></strong></p><h2>Early Life, Education, and Parents</h2><p>The popular member of the popular boy group BTS, V, was born Kim Tae-Hyung in Seo District, Daegu, South Korea. He is the eldest child of his parents, whose name is unfortunately unknown at the moment.</p><p>Likewise, he has two younger siblings, a sister<strong>, Kim Eon Jin,</strong> and a brother, <strong>Kim Jeong Gyu.</strong> V first got the inspiration to be a singer when he was in elementary school. Since then, he began taking saxophone lessons.</p><p>As for his education, V attended Korean Arts High School and graduated in 2014. As for now, V is enrolled in Global Cyber University.&nbsp;</p><h2>Early Career and Rise to Stardom</h2><p>BTS V was becoming a trainee for Big Hit Entertainment, was a bit of pure luck. He was scouted by the company when V was accompanying his friend for an audition. The staff was utterly baffled, hearing V’s deep baritone voice as he was initially selected for his visuals.</p><p>Soon after that, he moved to Seoul to pursue his music career and began his trainee life. Even before the debut of the group, V was kept hidden as a secret member.</p><p>Likewise, he made his official debut on June 13, 2013, as a BTS member on Mnet’s M Countdown with the track “No More Dream.”&nbsp;</p><p>Just like the staff, people were stunned over his deep voice, which contradicted his sweet, handsome visual. Nonetheless, V is a vocalist of the group who also contributes as a lyricist and composer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/v-0001.jpg><p>Moreover, V co-wrote and co-produced the song ‘Hold Me Tight,’ which was included in the album ‘The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1.’ Aside from that, he is credited for songs like Fun Boyz, Stigma, Hug Me, and Winter Bears.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, V released his second solo song, Singularity, which was a massive hit among the fandom and critics worldwide.</p><p>Different from his usual sound, the song featured a massive synth and base, which suited his raspy yet deep voice. Moreover, V was also added to the BTS dance line after the release of this song.</p><p>Following the event in October of the same year, V became one of the youngest recipients of the prestigious fifth-class Hwagwan Order of Cultural Merit medal, awarded by the President of South Korea. He received the medal alongside his group members.</p><p>Aside from singing and group activities, V is also active as an actor. In 2016, he debuted as an actor on-screen from the KBS2‘s historical drama Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth. He received much acclaim for his debut work.</p><h2>Professional Career: BTS For Life</h2><p>BTS is one of the biggest and best boy groups in the world right now. Straight from South Korea, this group consists of seven young men who share the same passion for music.</p><p>The members are Kim Namjoon, aka RM, Kim Seok-Jin, Min-Yoongi, aka Suga, <strong>Jung Hoseok, aka <a href=# rel=noopener>J-Hope</a></strong>, Jimin, V, and <a href=# rel=noopener>Jeon Jungkook</a>.</p><p>Likewise, the group has been together even before their debut. They made their official debut in 2013, initially as a hip-hop group, they later evolved their musical horizon and cover a wide range of genres.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/v-0005.jpg><p>Moreover, their music resonates with people of all ages as they talk about mental health, self-love and encourage people to lean towards positivity.</p><p>As of now, they have released over three Studio albums titled Dark & Wild(2014), Wings(2016), and Love Yourself: Tear(2018).&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bregje Heinen Bio- Net Worth, Age, Height, Model, Boyfriend, IG >></a></strong></p><h2>Personal Life: Is V from BTS Single?</h2><p>Many might not know this, but K-pop singers and artists are very private when it comes to their personal life. They might reveal some information on their lifestyle, but their dating life is especially covered for safety reasons.</p><p>Since BTS has transcended as an artist, V as a member has gathered many fans and admirers thanks to his godly looks and soulful voice.</p><p>Yes, we agree, he is a total package. However, as of now, this handsome man has not dated anyone. But this has not stopped fans from linking with him other female artists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/BTS-V-817x1024.jpg><p>As long as V himself does not confirm the relationship, we can not be sure of it. And we hope there will come a day when V, including other BTS members, will be able to profess their love publicly.</p><p>Fortunately, V is a loving man who loves his fans dearly. He often shares his likes with the fandom called ‘Army’ on their official Twitter.</p><p>Moreover, V posts his photographs under the name ‘Vante’ inspired by his favorite minimalist photographer, <strong>Ante Badzim</strong>.</p><h2>Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>: 29 million Followers&nbsp;</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>What does V have in mind for 2022?&nbsp;</h3><p>As of now, all V wants is to stay healthy and write better songs for his one and only Army. In addition, he wants to shoot a music video for them.&nbsp;</p><h3>What is Vante up to?</h3><p>First of all, to all new fans, Vante is another nickname of Taehyung, more so, for his artistic side. He is a big fan of professional photographer Ante and was inspired by him.&nbsp;</p><p>Since he is not traveling much due to the current situation, V has refrained from taking a lot of pictures.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>For more information on V and other BTS members, do check their interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">GQ Magazine</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57wa2qZq5dl7azwMedmLJlkZyybrTEop6hrF2nsqK4jKeYpp1do7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbts-v-birthday-age-height-real-name-net-worth.html&text=BTS%20V%20Birthday%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Real%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbts-v-birthday-age-height-real-name-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbts-v-birthday-age-height-real-name-net-worth.html&title=BTS%20V%20Birthday%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Real%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbts-v-birthday-age-height-real-name-net-worth.html&title=BTS%20V%20Birthday%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Real%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbts-v-birthday-age-height-real-name-net-worth.html&title=BTS%20V%20Birthday%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Real%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbts-v-birthday-age-height-real-name-net-worth.html&description=BTS%20V%20Birthday%2c%20Relationships%2c%20Real%20Name%20%26amp%3b%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nate-tibbetts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nate Tibbetts Wikipedia, Wiki, WNBA, Salary, Wife, Age, Coach, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-msi-b350m-gaming-pro-review-micro-size-micro-price.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="BIOS And Software - The MSI B350M Gaming Pro Review: Micro Size, Micro Price">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
