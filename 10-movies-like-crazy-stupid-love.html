With a stellar cast and a great premise, plus a twist at the end that no one saw coming, the film is a standout even now, more than a decade on.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 id=h-what-is-crazy-stupid-love-about data-injectable=false>What is Crazy, Stupid, Love about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=581 data-injectable=true>The film is composed of a phenomenal ensemble cast, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Steve Carell</a>, Julianne Moore, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Emma Stone</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ryan Gosling</a> in lead roles, you also have great characters from younger talent in the form of Jonah Bobo and Lio Tipton including some appearances from the fantastic Kevin Bacon.</p><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>Crazy, Stupid, Love immediately introduces us to characters who are already living their lives, Cal (Carell) and Emily Weaver (Moore) have been married for some time and are on a date night, and Hannah (Stone) is out with a friend taking a quick break from studying to be a lawyer, Jacob (Gosling) is at the bar hitting on women which we observe is a regular thing for him, and Robbie (Bobo) is admitting from the outset his love for his older babysitter Jessica (Tipton).</p><p data-characters=494 data-current-count=494 data-injectable=true>The film wastes no time in throwing us right into the story with Emily announcing she wants a divorce only a minute into the story. From there we see the highs and lows of relationships, both romantic and familial, we see how love is tested, how it can grow, and the importance of self-love as well. The film then also reveals near the end that the separate storylines are also not as separate as we had been led to believe, tying everything together is a rather wonderful, if complicated, bow.</p><p data-characters=406 data-current-count=406 data-injectable=true>The film is well-loved by fans of the genre, with great chemistry to be had between the actors, truly heartwarming moments as well as some legitimate laughs, as well as a guy finally getting a makeover rather than a woman for once! But if you’ve watched it a thousand times and are wondering “What else is out there that can scratch this itch?” then here are twelve films you might enjoy.</p><h2 id=h-no-strings-attached data-injectable=false>No Strings Attached</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_671878.png><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=708 data-injectable=true>A great romantic comedy to watch after Crazy, Stupid, Love is No Strings Attached. The movie follows two lifelong friends named Emma and Adam who decide to take their platonic relationship to a physical one. They are afraid of ruining their friendship, though, so the two decide to make a pact that things will simply remain physical. Their only goal is to not fall in love, but obviously, this is not easy.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=138 data-injectable=false>Starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher, this movie will have you laughing, smiling, and crying – just like Crazy, Stupid, Love.</p><h2 id=h-the-vow data-injectable=false>The Vow</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_95688f.png><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>The Vow stars Rachel McAdams and Channing Tatum, who play happy newlyweds named Paige and Leo. Unfortunately, their life gets turned upside down when Paige gets in a horrible car accident that leaves her without her memory. She can’t remember Leo and feels something for a former fiance, which only serves to complicate things. Despite all of this, Leo is determined to remind her of their love story and rebuild what they once had.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>Like Crazy, Stupid, Love, the characters have incredible chemistry that makes the movie a memorable one.</p><h2 id=h-love-actually data-injectable=false>Love Actually</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_b33c34.png><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>If you are a fan of an ensemble piece where things are all interconnected then Love Actually is probably one of the best films within the rom-com genre that does this. The film is uplifting and hopeful and balances corniness with real depth at times as well (something the Hollywood attempts failed at).</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=509 data-injectable=true>Much like Crazy, Stupid, Love we see relationships at all different stages, from young love, to love breaking apart. It is a classic at any time of the year, though is usually best enjoyed around Christmas.</p><h2 id=h-la-la-land data-injectable=false>La La Land</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_bdae02.png><p data-characters=385 data-current-count=685 data-injectable=true>If you loved <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stone and Gosling’s chemistry</a> in Crazy, Stupid, Love then you should really watch them in La La Land. The film may be a musical, and it may have extreme dance numbers and aerial acrobatics, but the heart of it is the relationship between the two characters. The film is beautiful, and crushing at the same time, proving that sometimes love isn’t always enough.</p><p data-characters=281 data-current-count=281 data-injectable=false>Their relationship in Crazy, Stupid, Love only really came in at the end, and it was beautiful to watch, so here you get to see them really interact and work opposite one another. Both were great in La La Land with Stone even winning the Oscar for Best Actress for her performance.</p><h2 id=h-definitely-maybe data-injectable=false>Definitely, Maybe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_452070.png><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=450 data-injectable=true>One of the things that really ground Crazy, Stupid, Love in a sense of realism was the fact that it really portrayed the struggles of relationships. Definitely, Maybe is another film that works well in this aspect, as we see Will Hayes telling his daughter about his past relationships as she tries to guess which one of his past great loves is her mother, keeping the audience guessing and allowing a reveal at the end much like Crazy, Stupid, Love.</p><p data-characters=257 data-current-count=257 data-injectable=false>Through the lens of “look, relationships are hard, and sometimes they don’t always work,” Definitely, Maybe is a great film. That and we also have another romantic lead played by another famous Ryan, this time in the form of Ryan Reynolds.</p><h2 id=h-when-harry-met-sally data-injectable=false>When Harry Met Sally</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_f1d8da.png><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=290 data-injectable=false>When Harry Met Sally is a classic and is a film that we will never not recommend. The story of two people, starting off as friends, growing together, challenging one another, and ultimately falling in love with one another is timeless, and this film probably does it better than any other.</p><p data-characters=162 data-current-count=452 data-injectable=true>Again, it is the organic nature of this film that Crazy, Stupid, Love also has, with the interactions between characters feeling genuine, leaving us wanting more.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Kids are Alright</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_7b3ba3.png><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=607 data-injectable=true>Featuring Julianne Moore, The Kids are Alright is less of a romance and more of a family drama/comedy. Again, there is a focus on the hardships that come with marriage, with very human mistakes being made, and seeing how a couple can work through betrayal and regret whilst trying to hold a family together.</p><p data-characters=241 data-current-count=241 data-injectable=false>Much like Crazy, Stupid, Love it really looks at the family dynamic during these stressful times and how forgiveness can allow us to move forward. This film was critically lauded and was nominated for Best Picture at the 2011 Academy Awards.</p><h2 id=h-easy-a data-injectable=false>Easy A</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_a2f60b.png><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>This film is Emma Stone’s to run away with. Easy A is a high school romantic comedy but feels new and bold in comparison to many that fall into that genre. Stone plays her role phenomenally, and with her parents played by Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, there is definitely a wholesome family dynamic at play too.</p><p data-characters=243 data-current-count=567 data-injectable=true>Much how Crazy, Stupid, Love has some great supporting actors so too does Easy A, with Amanda Bynes giving a stellar performance as the devout Christian who’s just a little off her rocker. Incredibly funny with Stone at her comedic best.</p><h2 id=h-dan-in-real-life data-injectable=false>Dan in Real Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_829740.png><p data-characters=350 data-current-count=650 data-injectable=true>Carell is known for playing characters that are just a little bit lost and perhaps just a little bit sad, as we see him at the beginning of Crazy, Stupid, Love. In Dan in Real Life, we get to see him once again as the loving caring father who has rather stopped caring after his own needs only to realize that sometimes he needs to put himself first.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=159 data-injectable=false>Another sweet wholesome romantic comedy with family playing a big part, this one has been recommended by many who love Crazy, Stupid, Love so go give it a try!</p><h2 id=h-this-is-40 data-injectable=false>This is 40</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_6a6007.png><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>If you want to see a film about the comedic highs and lows of marriage and parenting then This is 40 is a great choice. Directed by Judd Apatow as a sort of sequel to Knocked Up, it looks at the pressures one may face in life as you start to enter those middling years when you have to balance romances with raising a family and holding down a career.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>The humor is designed to be grounded in reality and with the great chemistry between lead actors Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann, as well as the addition of Apatow and Mann’s daughters Maude and Iris Apatow who nail their respective roles.</p><h2 id=h-love-and-other-drugs data-injectable=false>Love and Other Drugs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_9342f6.png><p data-characters=354 data-current-count=654 data-injectable=true>If you are looking for something light and airy this one may not be for you, but it would be a mistake to skip it all together. Much like Gosling’s character in Crazy, Stupid, Love, Jake Gyllenhaal’s character Jamie is a bit of a lothario and doesn’t really have love on his mind, that is until he meets Maggie, played by Anne Hathaway.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>The two have a beautiful, sweet relationship as they struggle with Jamie’s lack of experience in the world of love and also with Maggie’s early onset Parkinsons, with these two factors often driving a wedge between the couple. It does prove though, that love is sometimes worth those hardships.</p><h2 id=h-i-love-you-man data-injectable=false>I Love You, Man</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image_acdced.png><p data-characters=328 data-current-count=328 data-injectable=false>If one of your favorite parts of Crazy, Stupid, Love was the relationship between Cal and Jacob, you will probably like I Love You, Man. In this film it isn’t romance that our lead, played once again by Rudd, has any problems with, it’s that he doesn’t have any strong friendships outside of his relationship.</p><p data-characters=178 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=true>After some encouragement from his fiancé, he decides to go out and make a friend and here we meet the carefree, fun-loving, slightly mischievous character played by Jason Segel.</p><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>A bromance film can be just as rewarding as a romance, and this film has some classic moments within it.</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=311 data-injectable=false>So sure, go ahead and watch Crazy, Stupid, Love once again, we don’t blame you, but if you are down for a little bit of a change then maybe one of these other offerings will be right up your alley too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoaGllnaTDqrHSZqOio5VisLOt2bJkrKylpbalecuorZ5n</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html&text=12%20movies%20like%20Crazy%2c%20Stupid%2c%20Love&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html&title=12%20movies%20like%20Crazy%2c%20Stupid%2c%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html&title=12%20movies%20like%20Crazy%2c%20Stupid%2c%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html&title=12%20movies%20like%20Crazy%2c%20Stupid%2c%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-movies-like-crazy-stupid-love.html&description=12%20movies%20like%20Crazy%2c%20Stupid%2c%20Love" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./waffle-recipe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Homemade Waffle Recipe">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-spike-lees-brother-cinque-lee-bio-age-family-occupation-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Spike Lees brother Cinqu Lee?
