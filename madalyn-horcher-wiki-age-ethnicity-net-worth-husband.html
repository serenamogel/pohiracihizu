She is an actress who gained recognition after she portrayed Chloe Solano in the crime mystery mini-series “Gracepoint”, starring David Tennant, Anna Gunn and Virginia Kull, and which is about the police investigating the murder of a young boy – the series was very successful, and won one award while it was nominated for two others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-life-and-education></span>Early life and education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Madalyn was raised alongside her two younger sisters, Mira and Madison, both of whom are also actresses – Miya is known for her roles in “Fallout 4” in 2015 and “Killer in Suburbia” in 2020, while Madison is popular for starring in “Mail Order Monster” in 2018 and “Think Like a Dog” in 2020.</p><p>Madalyn became interested in acting while attending elementary school, where she was a member of the school’s drama club, and appeared in nearly all the plays performed there. She continued practicing acting upon enrolling at a local high school, and after finishing her first year in 2010, made her debut TV series appearance, guest starring as Beyonca in the episode “Puppy Love” of the family series “My Parents, My Sister & Me”, which actually aired only 10 episodes before it was cancelled.</p><p>Madalyn matriculated from high school in 2013, and then chose not to attend college but to focus on her acting career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=roles-in-tv-series></span>Roles in TV series<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After making her debut TV series appearance, Madalyn was invited to appear in single episodes of several series such as the medical mystery “House”, the comedy series “Fred: The Show”, and the family comedy series “Good Luck Charlie”.</p><p>In 2012, she was invited to guest star as Jacinta Flores in the episode “Wild Flowers” of the critically acclaimed crime mystery series “CSI: Crime Scene Investigation”, starring Laurence Fishburne, George Eads and Marg Helgenberger, and which is about a team of forensic evidence investigators who are working on cases in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p><p>Madalyn’s following role came two years later, when she portrayed Nikki in a single episode of the action comedy series “Kickin’ It”, and again two years later, she guest starred as Jaydin in the episode “Second Year” of the drama series “Code Black”.
