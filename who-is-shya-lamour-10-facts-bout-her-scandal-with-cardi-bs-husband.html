Shya’s Relationship With Cardi B, Offsets Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In an interview with TMZ on the 3rd of March 2019, Shya admits that Cardi B has helped Offset grow tremendously. She believes that since his marriage to Cardi B, he has become a better person and this is because Cardi B has a really good heart.</p><p>However, in recent times, Shya has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dissed Cardi</a> a couple of times in the past.

Although she captioned the video ‘Not a diss’, many people believe otherwise.</p><p></p><p>During the period Cardi announced a divorce from Offset, Shya, and Offset began to spend a lot of time together and Shya even made a post on Instagram about gaining ‘a lost one’ possibly referring to Offset.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Shya_Lamours_Scandal_With_Offset></span><strong>Shya L’amour’s Scandal With Offset</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The relationship between Shya and her baby father, Offset seem to have never been really smooth beginning from their relationship which did not last for so long to the drama of her revelation of their daughter who Offset initially denied and the follow-up drama which ensued when Shya accused Offset of being ignorant about his fatherly duties for their daughter.</p><p>She said Offset began to avoid her when he got hooked with his next lover and was expecting a child with her. He blocked her number and also on social media so she wasn’t able to reach out to him so she had to reach out to his mother through Facebook. Offset admitted during his interview with TMZ that as soon as he saw the picture of the daughter on Facebook, he knew she was his but he had to be certain about it.</p><p>The list about their back and forth seems to keep growing by the year because as of 2020, Shya cried out, again about not receiving enough financial support for their daughter from Offset.</p><p>An in-depth look into this scandal began after Shya gave birth to her daughter for Offset in 2015. While Offset initially denied having a child with Shya and even knowing her, he released a song titled ‘Father of 4’ where he addressed the issue surrounding his relationship with his daughter and baby mama.</p><p>Shya fired back at Offset after listening to the song and accused him of choosing to be ignorant about their child’s birth and narrating how she had to convince him to take a DNA test to prove the girl was his. The paternity as well as issue of child support was addressed in court proceedings and at a point, Shya had to notify Offset about the court case through a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">newspaper publication</a> because Offset was avoiding her.</p><p>There was also a case of a certain ‘love triangle’ which hit the internet after the news of Offset and Cardi B’s divorce. The news speculated that Offset was back with his baby mama, Shya but the rumors were put down after Offset and Cardi were seen together a month later.</p><p>Also, sometime in 2018 while Cardi and Offset secretly got married and she was pregnant with Kulture, Shya said Offset asked her for sex before he would pay child support. She leaked chats of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Offset begging her for sex </a>when the issue about him not paying for child support arose and Cardi B got involved asking for receipts of Offset’s alleged beg for sex. Shya took to her Instagram to rant about Offset and Cardi B and actually shared the receipts she was asked to share.</p><p>When Cardi B eventually announced her divorce from her husband Offset, it seemed like Shya and Offset rekindled their romance again as both of them were pictured spending a lot of time together, and even Offset shared photos of him and Shya with his daughter together.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51kxKm7jKKqZquYrq5uuMCmpq6qXWZ9brLAnKusZZKkwrV5x56pZquTlrulrctmrqKsmGKwor7DomSbq12dwrSuwKebaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html&text=Who%20Is%20Shya%20L%27amour%3f%2010%20Facts%20About%20Her%2c%20Scandal%20With%20Cardi%20Bs%20Husband&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Shya%20L%27amour%3f%2010%20Facts%20About%20Her%2c%20Scandal%20With%20Cardi%20Bs%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Shya%20L%27amour%3f%2010%20Facts%20About%20Her%2c%20Scandal%20With%20Cardi%20Bs%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html&title=Who%20Is%20Shya%20L%27amour%3f%2010%20Facts%20About%20Her%2c%20Scandal%20With%20Cardi%20Bs%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-shya-lamour-10-facts-bout-her-scandal-with-cardi-bs-husband.html&description=Who%20Is%20Shya%20L%27amour%3f%2010%20Facts%20About%20Her%2c%20Scandal%20With%20Cardi%20Bs%20Husband" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jan-broberg-i-was-abducted-by-a-paedophile-while-my-parents-watched.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jan Broberg: 'I was abducted by a paedophile while my parents watched'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./seiko-yamamoto-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-274842-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Seiko Yamamoto Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
