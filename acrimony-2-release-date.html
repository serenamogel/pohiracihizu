The film starred Taraji P. Henson as Melinda Moore Gayle and Lyriq Bent as Robert Gayle and explored themes of deception, resentment, and the destructive power of bitterness.</p><p>Fans of the film have been eagerly waiting for a sequel to find out what happens next to the characters, and whether there is any hope for redemption or reconciliation. Here is everything you need to know about Acrimony Season 2, the anticipated follow-up to the psychological thriller.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Acrimony_2_Release_Date></span>Acrimony 2 Release Date<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There has been no official announcement of the <a href=#>release date for Acrimony 2</a>, as of October 6, 2023. However, some sources have speculated that the sequel might come out in late 2023 or early 2024, based on the production schedule of Tyler Perry and his studio. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first film was released</a> on March 30, 2018, after being filmed in eight days in October 2017.</p><p>If the sequel follows a similar timeline, it could be expected to hit the theaters in about a year after filming begins. However, this is not confirmed and fans will have to wait for an official confirmation from Tyler Perry or Lionsgate, the distributor of the film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Acrimony-2-Cast.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cast></span>Cast<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The cast of Acrimony Season 2 has not been officially revealed yet, but it is likely that the main actors from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">first film will reprise</a> their roles.

These trailers use clips from the first film and other movies or shows featuring the actors to create a hypothetical scenario for the sequel. Some of these trailers are:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><ul><li>Acrimony no. 2 (Official Trailer), which has over 1.6 million views and shows Melinda surviving her fall from the boat and seeking revenge on Robert and Diana.</li><li>Tyler Perry’s Acrimony 2 | Movie Trailer, which has over 1.3 million views and shows Melinda being alive and in prison, while Robert and Diana face troubles in their marriage.</li><li>Acrimony Part 2 Trailer, which has over 1 million views and shows Melinda being rescued by a fisherman and plotting to ruin Robert’s life.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Netflix></span>Netflix<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Acrimony is not available on Netflix in the US, but it is available on other streaming platforms such as Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, Google Play Movies & TV, YouTube Movies, iTunes, and FandangoNOW. It is also possible to watch Acrimony on Netflix in some other countries such as Canada, Australia, UK, India, South Africa, and Nigeria. However, this might change depending on the licensing agreements between Netflix and Lionsgate. As for Acrimony 2, there is no information on whether it will be available on Netflix or not.

The first film ended with a shocking twist, where Melinda attacked Robert and Diana on their yacht, and tried to kill them.</p><p>She was shot by Robert in self-defense, and fell into the water, presumably dead. However, some fans have speculated that she might have survived and that the sequel will show her return and seek vengeance on Robert and Diana. Alternatively, some fans have suggested that the sequel will focus on Robert and Diana’s marriage, and how they deal with the trauma and guilt of what happened with Melinda. There might also be some flashbacks or revelations that shed more light on the past and present of the characters, and their motivations and actions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Conclusion></span>Conclusion<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Acrimony 2 is a highly anticipated sequel to Tyler Perry’s Acrimony, a psychological thriller that captivated audiences with its story of a bitter divorce and its consequences.
