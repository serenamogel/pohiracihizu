Her parents, James Douglas and Monnie M. Glass, raised her in Potter County, Texas. Jan later relocated to Tulsa, where she also won the Miss Tulsa pageant.</p><p>Shas lived her life away from the media spotlight, which is why there are little details about her. We don’t know much about Ashley’s birth or childhood days right now, but we do know her age. Jan Ashley will be in her early 70s in 2020.</p><p>According to a report published on Radar Online in January 2012, Ashley is a 63-year-old lady.</p><h2><span id=She_is_Robert_Kardashian8217s_second_wife>She is Robert Kardashian’s second wife.</span></h2><p>On November 25, 1998, Jan Ashley married businessman and lawyer Robert Kardashian.</p><p>Jan hid her relationship with Robert for a long time. She did, however, spill the beans to Radar Online in 2014. Jan stated that she met her ex-husband in early 1998 when selling her house.</p><p>“I was selling my house, and he came through it, and he saw my picture,” Jan recalled. She went on to say, “He called one of my husband’s actors to have him introduced to me.”</p><p>They began dating soon after and dated for seven months until Robert proposed to her in Hawaii. Jan stated that she and Robert married in Vail, Colorado, on November 25th and left for their honeymoon the next day with his four children.</p><p>Ashley and Robert, on the other hand, couldn’t stay married for long, as they divorced just a month later. Their divorce was formalized in 1999. Ashley said that their broken marriage was due to the regular upheaval and turbulence caused by Robert’s ex-wife Kris and their children.</p><p>Robert previously married Kris Jenner, from whom he divorced in 1991. Kourtney Kardashian, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, and Robert Kardashian Jr. are the children of Robert and Kris.</p><p>According to Robert’s statement, they divorced because he did not want to have another child.</p><p>According to the legal paperwork Robert filed in court, the reason for their divorce was Robert’s disinterest in having a child with Ashley. Before they married in 1998, Robert and Ashley promised to have a child together, according to the paperwork.</p><p>However, after tying the knot, Robert changed his mind. He stated that he didn’t want any more biological children because he already had four. It eventually resulted to Ashley’s divorce from Robert.<br>Jan Ashley and Robert Kardashian divorced within a month of each other.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ashley seemed to be telling a different narrative. She denied Robert’s assertion in a 2014 interview with Radar Online, saying she had no intention of having a child with him. Furthermore, she stated that if she had desired a kid, she would have had it with her first husband, John.</p><h2><span id=Jan_Ashley8217s_ex-husband_remarried_just_before_his_death>Jan Ashley’s ex-husband remarried just before his death.</span></h2><p>Following the dissolution of their brief marriage, Robert Kardashian began dating real estate businesswoman Ellen Pierson. Robert and Ellen married in 2003 after a five-year engagement. Meanwhile, only months before their wedding, Robert Kardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer.</p><p>The long-time attorney died of cancer six weeks after Robert married Ellen. Robert passed away on September 30, 2003, at the age of 59, and was laid to rest in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Ellen and Robert did not have children. Ellen Pierson did not date anyone after her husband’s death, and she currently lives a solitary life away from the media spotlight.</p><h2><span id=Ashley_previously_was_married_to_an_actor>Ashley previously was married to an actor.</span></h2><p>Previously, Jan Asley was married to actor John Ashley. John was a well-known producer and vocalist in addition to being an actor. Suicide Battalion, How to Make a Monster, Apocalypse Now, Invisible Mom, and Scar City are among his most popular films. John is also recognized for producing a number of popular television shows, including The A-Team.</p><p>When it comes to Jan Ashley’s marriage to John, there is no specific information on when and where they married; nonetheless, it is known that she remained married to John until he died in 1997. On October 3, 1997, at the age of 62, John died of a heart attack in New York City.</p><p>Actor John has been married twice before. In 1962, he married actress Deborah Walley and had a son, Anthony Ashley. In 1966, they divorced. Following that, John married Nancy Moore. He also has a son with his second wife, Cole Ashley.</p><h2><span id=Ashley_asserted_Khloe_Kardashian_was_not_Robert_Kardashian8217s_biological_child>Ashley asserted Khloe Kardashian was not Robert Kardashian’s biological child.</span></h2><p>Ashley made waves in the early 2010s when she discussed Khloe Kardashian’s paternity in the media. She and Robert’s third wife Ellen confirmed in an interview with Star Magazine that Khloe is not Robert’s biological child. Ashley stated,</p><p>“He told me after we married that Khloe is not his child.” He just looked at me and uttered [it] as if it were a matter of fact. ‘Well, you know Khloe isn’t really a Kardashian, don’t you?’ he asked. And I said… ‘OK,’ and that was the end of it.”</p><p>According to Ashley and Ellen, Robert was aware that Kris had cheated on him with a couple of men while they were married. Meanwhile, Kris Jenner admitted to having an affair during her marriage to Robert in her 2011 biography, Kris Jenner… And All Things Kardashian.</p><p>Following that, Khloe Kardashian resorted to Twitter to attack her father’s widow and ex-wife. Her tweet read as follows:</p><p>“You have the audacity to mention my father’s name like this!” You should be embarrassed of yourself! I’ve let a lot of things slip, but this one is particularly low… YOU ARE HORRIBLE! (Yes, you know who I’m talking about.)”</p><p>Khloe Kardashian couldn’t stop herself from asking her mother if she was adopted after hearing the news. It was also featured on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, their family reality show.</p><p>During an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Khloe also underwent a DNA test, but it was merely to prove that Kris Jenner was her mother.</p><p>In his court statement, Robert acknowledged Khloe as his biological child.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/family-life-and-hefty-net-worth-of-bumper-robinson/"}{"1":61}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Family Life and Hefty Net Worth Of Bumper Robinson</a></span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity ex wife</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>All About Jimmy Fortune | Age, Net Worth, Relationship, Career</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Angelo Adkins | Adele’s Son, His Mother’s Postpartum Depression</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn66vecCsn6WdqWKuo7vUrWSrp5Kav7V5ypqpnZmjnbaiutJmnLFlp56zpns%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjan-ashley-about-robert-kardashians-ex-wife.html&text=Jan%20Ashley%20%7c%20About%20Robert%20Kardashians%20Ex-wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjan-ashley-about-robert-kardashians-ex-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjan-ashley-about-robert-kardashians-ex-wife.html&title=Jan%20Ashley%20%7c%20About%20Robert%20Kardashians%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjan-ashley-about-robert-kardashians-ex-wife.html&title=Jan%20Ashley%20%7c%20About%20Robert%20Kardashians%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjan-ashley-about-robert-kardashians-ex-wife.html&title=Jan%20Ashley%20%7c%20About%20Robert%20Kardashians%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjan-ashley-about-robert-kardashians-ex-wife.html&description=Jan%20Ashley%20%7c%20About%20Robert%20Kardashians%20Ex-wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mohawk-2018.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mohawk movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2018)">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-are-stephanie-allynne-and-tig-notaro-meet-the-couple-and-their-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Are Stephanie Allynne And Tig Notaro?
